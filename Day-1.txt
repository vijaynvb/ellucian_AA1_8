1. Experience -> unsupervised
2. Academics [1-10, 11, 12, ] fourier series -> supervised

    3. elctronics 


1. speech recognization: 

voice -> Analog signal -> Sampeling theorm [time and density] -> against a state diagrma 
    phonims -> ah, ba
   Deep learning -> neural network -> 
    -> [he] -> [ll] -> [o] -> hello
    -> [wa] -> [ha] -> [te]



trained -> transformeres -> llm 
    1. infrastructure  -> 1000 gpu's to train the model 
    2. 8 month's
    3. complete internetdata 

    100 million$, 75 million 

llm -> algorithm [transformeres] + data [dog barking, glass breaking] [slm] cctv [iot] -> sms 
    1. CPU + GPU


Scaling -> managing the load in a application 
    application  -> [8cpu's, 32gb ram, 100 mbps n/w, 1 tb hdd] -> 100 concurrent 
        Scaling -> 
            1. vertical scaling -> [16cpu's, 64gb ram, 1000 mbps n/w, 1 tb ssd] -> 200 concurrent 
            2. horizontal scaling -> [16cpu's, 64gb ram, 1000 mbps n/w, 1 tb ssd] -> 200 concurrent 
                                      [16cpu's, 64gb ram, 1000 mbps n/w, 1 tb ssd] -> 200 concurrent 
                                       [16cpu's, 64gb ram, 1000 mbps n/w, 1 tb ssd] -> 200 concurrent 
                                        [16cpu's, 64gb ram, 1000 mbps n/w, 1 tb ssd] -> 200 concurrent 
                                         [16cpu's, 64gb ram, 1000 mbps n/w, 1 tb ssd] -> 200 concurrent 
                                          [16cpu's, 64gb ram, 1000 mbps n/w, 1 tb ssd] -> 200 concurrent 
        
        Distributed Network: 
            lambda's -> functional programing [independently] 
                you pass the details required as parameter [context] -> process the method -> return
